        <p>Hello! I am Avishi Chaudhary, a daughter from an immigrant household. This is why, airplanes and the sky have played a huge role in getting me where I am. My parents and I moved to the US in December 2019 from the northern part of India, Rajasthan, and recently got US citizenship! My interests in design, space, and the workings of machinery, have led me to major in Mechanical Engineering (entering my Junior Year next semester) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. When not thinking about making a career at NASA or reading space news, I help others in my community by being part of Community groups cooking for myself and my parents, or helping freshmen move in into college. I can't wait to share all my involvement and experiences!</p>
