        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am Avishi Chaudhary, a daughter from an immigrant household. My interests in design, space, and the workings of machinery, have led me to major in Mechanical Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). When not thinking about making a career at NASA or reading space news, I try to help others in my community by being part of Community groups, or cook for myself or my parents. Can't wait to share all of my involvements and experiences since coming to the United States! </p>
